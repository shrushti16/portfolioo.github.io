Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠 Projects

### *Traffic Management*  

*OVERVIEW:*  

Efficient Traffic Flow:
Implement advanced traffic signal control systems using real-time data to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow. Use AI algorithms to optimize signal timings based on current road conditions.

Digital Complaint Filing:
Provide citizens with a digital platform to file complaints regarding traffic violations, road conditions, or other issues. Ensure transparency and efficient tracking through unique complaint IDs and real-time status updates.

Automated Fine Management:
Integrate an automated system to detect violations, issue fines, and manage payments online. Support multiple payment methods like credit/debit cards, UPI, and mobile wallets. Generate digital payment receipts instantly.

Fancy Number Plate Allocation:
Allow vehicle owners to apply for custom number plates online. Check plate availability, make payments, and track the allocation process through the platform.

National Permit Management:
Simplify the process of applying for national vehicle permits. Collect vehicle details, route information, and required documents digitally. Issue digital permits to reduce paperwork and enhance efficiency.

User-Friendly Interface:
Create accessible mobile and web applications for citizens to interact with traffic services. Include dashboards for traffic authorities to monitor, manage, and optimize traffic operations efficiently.
